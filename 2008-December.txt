Subject: [Iometer-svn] latest dynamo src/binary for Linux (FC6)
Message-ID: <372734.3168.qm@web53009.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I am trying to download the latest-n-greatest dynamo src/binary for Linux (FC6). 
Ran into a problem with iometer-2006_07_27.linux.i386 package: unable to increase avgqu-sz (avg queue depth reported by iostat) above 1 range, although iomter gui (windows-based) specifies qd=1,4,16,64. Also tried multiple (eg., 8, 16) iometer workers - avgqu-sz gets stuck at 2. 

Load/throughput correspondingly low compared to windows on same config.
Removed O_DIRECT from open() in IOTargetDisk.cpp, recompiled dynamo, same pblem.

Looks like fix has already been checked into dynamo src. Tried "svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/iometer/iometer/branches/IOMETER-restruct
svn: Can't connect to host 'svn.berlios.de': Connection refused

Would like to download latest-n-greatest bits as soon as possible, both src and executable (if available).

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Robert

I should also mention that I have specified a mounted Linux filesystem as iometer target. The reason is that I am characterizing/tuning perf of a single-drive notebook platform. Created 4G Linux partition on same drive as boot partition; created fs in the 4G parition; mounted under /DYNOTEST. Dynamo did create /DYNOTEST/iobw.tst as expected, yielded expected results for qd=1.

So, what do I need to do to get dynamo to correctly generate high qd load on this platform?

Thanks,
Robert
